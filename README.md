# Credit-Risk-Model-Validation-and-Explainability-Framework

Developed and validated a credit default prediction model using supervised machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
Performed conceptual soundness checks, model performance benchmarking, and bias explainability using SHAP and statistical tests.
Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize validation results and generate an automated model validation report for governance documentation.
